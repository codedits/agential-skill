A practical guide for AI models on asking clarifying questions that any user—especially those with little to no coding background—can easily understand and answer.

## Core Principles

1. **Speak in Everyday Human Terms**: Never ask about technical plumbing (e.g., SSR, state hydration, web workers, debouncing). Ask about what the user sees and experiences on their screen.
2. **Offer 2 to 3 Simple Choices**: Provide concrete choices with one marked **(Recommended)** so the user can easily reply with a single number or letter.
3. **Limit to 1–3 Key Questions at a Time**: Never bombard the user with dozens of questions. Focus on the most important decisions first.

## Web & App Question Translation Guide

| Technical Jargon (DO NOT ASK) | Beginner-Friendly Question (USE THIS) |
| :--- | :--- |
| "Should we use Client-Side Routing or Multi-Page MPA architecture?" | "When navigating between pages, should the screen transition instantly without a browser page reload, or load as standard individual web pages?" |
| "Do you want optimistic UI updates or an async spinner?" | "When someone submits a form or clicks a button, should the change appear on screen immediately, or show a subtle loading spinner until saved?" |
| "Should animations run on JS requestAnimationFrame or CSS keyframes?" | "Would you prefer smooth, lightweight animations that won't lag even on older laptops and phones?" |
| "What color theme and design tokens should we implement?" | "What visual vibe do you want for your site: **(A)** Modern Dark Mode with subtle glowing accents, or **(B)** Clean, bright Minimalist Light Mode?" |
| "How should the search input query the backend?" | "Should the search results update automatically as the user types, or only after they press 'Enter' / click 'Search'?" |
